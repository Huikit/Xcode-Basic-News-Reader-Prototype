### Xcode-Basic-News-Reader-Prototype
A simple news reader prototype built with Xcode.

***

#### Description
The goal for me was to build a working app with a few features:
1. let's user scroll through list and articles
2. simple page transitions
3. let's users touch articles

####
The news articles are from `www.theverge.com`  
The design is heavily influenced by the verge.
The goal was to focus on building a working app and not so much on the design.
