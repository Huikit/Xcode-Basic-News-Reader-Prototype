### Xcode-Basic-News-Reader-Prototype
A simple news reader prototype built with Xcode.

***

#### Description
The goal for me was to build a working app with a few features:

1. let's user scroll through list and articles  
2. simple page transitions  
3. let's users touch articles  

#### Sources
The news articles are from `www.theverge.com`  
The design is heavily influenced by the verge.  
The goal was to focus on building a working app and not so much on the design.
